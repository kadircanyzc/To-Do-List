# Project To-Do:

It was aimed to create a to do list where users could register and log in.
This way, each user has their own to-do list.
Firebase authentication was used for users to register and log in.
Firebase realtime database and localStorage were used to enable users to add data to their to-do list.
In the project, it is possible for users to reset their passwords.
